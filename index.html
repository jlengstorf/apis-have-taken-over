                ## Pick an App

                Note: Uber uses SendGrid to send email. Instagram uses the Facebook Places API (formerly Foursquare) for location sharing. Pretty much every app sending SMS uses Twilio. These are all examples of APIs silently powering the web.

                Note: In order to be competitive, apps and services need to offer more and more features. (Yes, I know there are a lot of apps that are trying to do one thing and do it well — those are the services secretly powering the web.)

                ## It&rsquo;s Actively Maintained

                Note: There&rsquo;s a whole team dedicated to maintaining the service. This is their business model, so you know uptime and reliability are really the only things they have going for their reputation.

        <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
                ## It&rsquo;s Cheaper

                Note: Twilio costs $0.0075 per message. At 1,000,000 messages sent per month, it costs $90,000/year. The average salary for a senior developer is around $100,000/year, and maintaining a service with that kind of volume is probably more than a one-person job.

                Note: Third-party services can go down. They can undergo emergency maintenance. Shit happens. But that can happen with an in-house solution as well (and — honestly — that&rsquo;s probably more likely).

                Note: Tech companies are always being purchased, changing offerings, or just running out of money. It falls on your judgment to choose services that show stability. Using a service that has lots of big-name clients is a good indication that you&rsquo;ll probably be fine.

                Note: Something you do is unique and useful. People want it. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re in business. It could be the data you collect; it could be the way you process certain data; it could be that you&rsquo;ve solved a problem that has an application beyond the scope of how you use it.

                ## You Could Benefit from Seeing Other Use Cases

                Note: Flickr used to be an online game with a photo sharing component. Facebook used to be a Hot or Not clone. Instagram was a check-in app. Seeing how people use the service shows you where the interest lies, and opening the service up to developers accelerates your ability to see how people use the data.

                ## Businesses Live and Die by the Developer Community

                Note: Developers are the web&rsquo;s tastemakers. If they pick up a service and run with it, it will most likely become pervasive: Twitter, Foursquare, etc. are good examples.

                ## There&rsquo;s Gold in Them There APIs

                Note: You can monetize your service, especially if it solves a common business challenge. Twilio is a fantastic example of a company that was founded exclusively to be a service — there is no public-facing Twilio product to speak of.

                ## Drink Your Own Kool-Aid

                Note: You should use the same API internally that you expose publicly (obviously the super special proprietary stuff should be gated for internal use only). Keeping the public and private APIs unified makes for easier maintenance and ensures consistency. It also avoids neglecting the public-facing API when things get busy.

            <script type="text/template">
                ## Be RESTful

                Note: The API should probably be RESTful. That&rsquo;s the current standard, and it makes adoption easier for everyone.

            <script type="text/template">
                ## Follow the Rules

                Note: Building a RESTful API requires some forethought and solid architecture. Don&rsquo;t cut corners here or you WILL regret it in the future.

                ## Believe in the Power of Good Docs

                Note: Writing good documentation is as important as building a good service. Without good docs, adoption will crawl, and the benefits evaporate. See: PHP docs, jQuery docs, Heroku docs, Stripe docs — good docs increase adoption and lower the amount of support headaches immensely.

                Note: Don&rsquo;t be weird about usage. Set clear guidelines for acceptable use, but don&rsquo;t be unnecessarily strict. Nobody likes a black box; I&rsquo;m looking at you, App Store approval process.
